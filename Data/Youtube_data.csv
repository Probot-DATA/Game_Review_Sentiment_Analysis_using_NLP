444,youtube,@unstoppableseeker1129,"I do like the update if I’m being honest. It starting to feel like the og clash Royale that I loved. I don’t like that there is no longer draws, instead someone loses even if they would have won with their last push, instead of being a draw. The only thing I don’t like about this update is the Hero’s. Champions are still new to the game and not a lot are added. Just to add something else?! Hero’s? That are already just like evolutions. It’s no different and I know Clash Royale will lose Wayyy too lots of players because simply hero’s. If yall actually read these comments and hear them out. Or at least me. Please reconsider adding heros. Rather introduce them only as event modes. Like with the super mini pekka. I took a lot of time to look at update, feel it out, to come here and comment. So please consider my comment heavily. Thank you",2 days ago,Heros

It took me over two years of time and effort to reach level 15 since it was introduced. Now, supercell is telling me that the new level 15 will be compressed—essentially becoming the old level 14. This means the past two years of effort were practically wasted. The more dedicated a player is in maxing out their cards, the bigger the penalty they face... I’m truly disappointed and speechless that supercell would penalize their most loyal players like this.
Back when the elite level (Lv15) was introduced, supercell stated that the upgrade mechanism for Lv15 was different—it was the highest level, the cap, likely to avoid player backlash. Now, they’re removing the elite level, and in the end, it’s the most loyal players who have to bear the cost.",2 days ago,Heros

On the other hand the heroes stuff despite looking really cool It does look like it's going to change the game a lot, and I don't think it's going to be for the better. I really think that you should have first released evos for all of the cards since now there are cards with both evo and hero status, and some that don't have either, taking away freedom when choosing which cards to put in your deck.

It's not like you need to INSTANTLY unlock every single card at the highest level possibile and you NEED to be in the top arena, just take your time and enjoy the game, jeez... and guess what, keeping adding new levels is crucial to breath new life into the game, and they've done that since the game first came out, same with coc, so nothing new, it's just reasonable",4 days ago (edited),Heros

They unironically said that they added level 15 because the player counts spiked when level 14 was added, completely ignoring the fact that an entire new rarity was added in that same update and that’s the actual reason we all flocked back to the game. We didn’t go “Oh boy, I can give my troops marginally better stats that mean nothing when my opponent’s cards are maxed too!” We went “Oh boy, a new rarity! And the archer queen too?!”

And I'm 100% sure they are gonna nerf it right after they earn enough money. Tbh, this lust of money will ruin the game. 

Once garena free fire used to do such things, they add new guns skins of similar stats and nerf the old ones so that they could earn more money with this new skin having same stats. It means the player don't get the thing they paid for. Idk but someone with potential influencing power should rise voice against it. 

In garena free fire, one influencer named skylord alone created enough for to the company to stop such dirty marketings.

I started playing again a couple months ago when my friends did because I wanted to show them up and I had to relearn the entire game because they added like 20 evos, multiple new cards, reworked multiple cards, removed chests, and just changed so much and I learned it just fine but I think I would have just left immediately if I saw “heroes” 🤮",3 days ago,Heros

10779,youtube,@zara5023,"Whats the point in new arenas if they're not full of cards? Half of the existing arenas don't have cards. On the subject of not enough cards, we don't have enough commons and rares in clash royale. There should be more commons and rares than any other rarity because you can't unlock the other rarities until later arenas, but I think theres 29 commons, 29 rares and 32 epics? There should be what, 17 more commons and rares, meaning 34 cards total, since you only unlock epics at arena 6 and generalising that all arenas (except the tutorial one) should have 2 cards of each rarity that you've unlocked so far that FIT THE ARENA THEME.

But yeah. An easier fix would just be to lower the arenas that rarer cards are unlocked at as to lower the load of new cards that are needed to fill out arenas equally. Another thing that would help is rarity fixing. You could change the rarity of certain cards to better match  their complexity, which seems to be how rarity was intended to work, especially with legendarys.

A few things that I would suggest are night witch & inferno dragon down to epic, and prince, baby dragon, and skeleton army to rare off the top of my head, but I think every person would probably have their own opinion on how card rarities should change.",2 days ago,Heros

Other from that we are going from 2 evos and 1 champ to 2 evos and 2 chaps(/heroics), basically the same shit, tbh opens a new world to cr and if done right: by having much more involvment by the player, on what he wants, what evo, champ, heroic, i would argue even other cards, it would be great. Now, ig, this story ends the same way almost every time. Why i am even under levelled, why there is so much hate for this stupid cash grabbing ass company with a team that actually makes the game what it is(good core mechanics) and they shit on their faces with the want for money from prob some board overlooking this shit. I know they do a lot outside their games, but i see some other ""greedy"" companies (all of them basically) and i dont have this fucking problem. Not a single one is as bad as cr, not even other supercell games.

muskteer and knight are some of the most generic, least exciting cards in the entire game they could have chosen, and now they have both evolutions and hero alts. Wow.

It’s already annoying enough facing heavier decks or boss bandit spam and spending so much extra elixir to hold these pushes off. Like seriously when I saw that taunt i knew it was over like that just messes up card placements and is like a zap to everything around it like??? This new team for clash or something idek, more gimmicks and more money, this is what waters down the gameplay and this will put the game in a bad bad spot.

new system i assume you will allways reset back to 10k,and to get to 11.5k is 50 wins+1 for each loss making this system actually more than twice as grindy for a daily player and still about 33% grindier for people who didnt care to beginwith

Let's compare evos to heroes, evolutions had trailers, in-universe lore and they felt fresh to the gameplay, therefore adding not just to Clash Royale as a game but to the Clash universe itself, they were clearly part of a plan the dev team has been working on for a while now at that time. Heroes on the other hand are now just getting shoved in the game with no rhyme or reason, they just wanted to add the most broken overpowered game breaking things to the game to cash out while people are still playing, because tell me why does a Giant (aka an offensive troop that doesn't even target other troops) now the hardest counter to any ground tank? They didn't even finish releasing evos (which mind you was their ""long-term plan"" for the game's monetization, not level 16, or heroes, or any other crap) and they're already becoming redundant because why would you use your evo knight ever again in a graveyard deck over the hero knight that with the press of a button, can turn YOUR very own bad plays and mistakes into game winning scenarios.

And instead of getting 150 trophies per win, now you're gonna get only 30 which means it got devided by 5
So if you do the same effort as before to reach ranked you'll only get to 11000 because the total amount of trophies didn't get devided by 5

My will of playing it's at the ALL TIME lowest after this news.
1st: as you said: there are already EVO's. This is to much for 3 reasons
-Higher, higher, HIGHEST paywall. Cause one evo at month wasn't enough... SRY, TWO, ghost(Priced more than the pass... of course)
-CONFUSION. Not NOW, 4 new cards with 4 ability... you learn those. When they will become 20? All mixed together beetween Normal, evo and heroic form?
-Losing the target. Already, with the release it's clear you are doing this: Where is the December EVO? Nha Heroes this month... Cause... DHA.
2nd: RNG in the heroes unluck.
3rd: The POOR deck slots. What was the problem for the first 6 months of evo's? Firecracker, RG, cracker, rg, mortar, knight, knight, knight, bomber, bomber, bomber... The points it's clear... I think. Well, here we are again with 12 cards that can go in 2 deck slots... meta will be so various... right?... RIGHT?.

To me, it's not functionally different than just releasing a new champion, other than the fact that you can't use a normal knight and a hero knight in a single deck. Nobody batted an eye when boss bandit was released, but boss bandit is basically just a champion version of the normal bandit. I don't think heroes are much different than that. Also, sure, some of the abilities look busted, but like c'mon it's clash royale what do u expect? Of course they're gonna be busted so they can sell it to you and than nerf it later; it's nothing we haven't seen before. I think this concept of heroes is just more actually cool content that's not really worth getting upset over unlike some other things (LIKE LEVEL 16???).

11457,youtube,@D-S-G.,"innvader tried so hard to explain that the Level 16 Update was being over-hated from the information we had, just for supercell to drop the undefendable instant button press tower taunt with 9+ tiles of range.

I genuinely believe that if Supercell wanted and HAD to do this, they should have made alternate evos. I play a game called Arknights (i know gacha game, cringe af) who made a similar concept with Modules, where some characters got an X and a Y mod, with both having tangible differences most of the time. For example, a support based unit can have one mod around increasing a skill's defense shred to make each skill more potent, while the other decreases the downtime, allowing the character to use the skill more often, but with less shred than the other module. Modules weren't perfect, and some units got two modules that were either too similar, or two modules that did not fix any problems at all with the character's inherit kit.

They could have easily made the Musketeer into two Evos, with Evo X being the offensive sniper shot and keeping a purple color scheme, and Evo Y spawning a defensive building and rocking the gold one. They literally made it a point that you cannot use an Evolved and Champion Musketeer in the same deck. But that wouldn't let them add a new currency they can charge us for, and gate F2P progression with, would it? 

All this has done was made it so we are another step back to playing competitively in higher ladder. I was in pain realizing I was at a disadvantage without 4, and later 8 Evos which basically killed my will to play Clan Wars. Now I have around 15 Evos entirely free to play, but now I need some Hero cards for my war decks, otherwise I am behind the pay to plays. Guess this is the ""unending grind"" the devs want, us catching up to payers. There's no use fighting it, they're going to make bank with this and they know. Evos made millions off the back of youtubers, so this likely won't change that. We all are here, trapped in an endless purgatory of pig shaking butt and goblin crying emotes.",4 days ago (edited),Heros

AND WHY ARE YOU ALL HATING ON HEROES. IT WILL BE SO MUCH MORE DIVERSITY IN DECK BUILDING EVER. and you will get a hero for free, including that you still need a slot for champion, you may not need more heroes. also now with double champions and removed 3-card cycle you can do crazy decks. and heroes itself are very fun and don't you exited to play them?
also, evolution boxes are great, you will receive evolutions way faster, don't know how frequently we will get evolution boxes, but at least once a month is very good for account.

Entitled Whiners: F2P can hit top 200 with skill/grind (e.g., pros like iGalaxy/MortarTg). They rage ""dead game"" after 1 loss but log 10hrs/day.902fdf7665dc
Toxic Echo Chamber: Reddit/X rewards outrage—upvotes for ""Supercell hates F2P!"" Dox devs, death threats over balances. Ignore positives (tournaments, parties).959a49
Hypocrites: Complain P2W but buy passes. Hate updates pre-release, then grind them (e.g., loved evos after initial salt).79b2a43fb41c
Short Attention Span: Game's 9+ years old—stagnant meta inevitable. They want Clash Mini 2.0 but reject risks.276aa9
Bottom line: Community's ""stupid"" because they're addicted losers chasing ladder highs, blaming devs for their skill gaps/grind hate. Game's fine—ignore Reddit, play 2v2/parties, mute chat.

And I'm 100% sure they are gonna nerf it right after they earn enough money. Tbh, this lust of money will ruin the game. 

Once garena free fire used to do such things, they add new guns skins of similar stats and nerf the old ones so that they could earn more money with this new skin having same stats. It means the player don't get the thing they paid for. Idk but someone with potential influencing power should rise voice against it. 

In garena free fire, one influencer named skylord alone created enough for to the company to stop such dirty marketings.

That’s both faster and more flexible since it doesn’t follow the limitations of regular cards. This 1 elixir ability is by far the most broken thing ever introduced into the game, they could immediately make the ability 2 elixir, halve the radius and it would still be too strong imo.

Heroes just ruined the entire point of champions and at their current state the abilities are better than all current champion abilities.,1 day ago,Heros
13344,youtube,@0Lvs1,"​ @KrisMLGx  I mean what point of the champions did they ruin? the only difference is that they're already existing cards but with abilities. I guess it's a bit lazy not designing a whole new champion to add a new ability to the game, but I find the idea of heroes interesting (if they can make them balanced and not too p2w, as there is no way they won't monetize every new addition to the game)",1 day ago,Heros

Toxic Echo Chamber: Reddit/X rewards outrage—upvotes for ""Supercell hates F2P!"" Dox devs, death threats over balances. Ignore positives (tournaments, parties).959a49
Hypocrites: Complain P2W but buy passes. Hate updates pre-release, then grind them (e.g., loved evos after initial salt).79b2a43fb41c
Short Attention Span: Game's 9+ years old—stagnant meta inevitable. They want Clash Mini 2.0 but reject risks.276aa9
Bottom line: Community's ""stupid"" because they're addicted losers chasing ladder highs, blaming devs for their skill gaps/grind hate. Game's fine—ignore Reddit, play 2v2/parties, mute chat.

And I'm 100% sure they are gonna nerf it right after they earn enough money. Tbh, this lust of money will ruin the game. 

Once garena free fire used to do such things, they add new guns skins of similar stats and nerf the old ones so that they could earn more money with this new skin having same stats. It means the player don't get the thing they paid for. Idk but someone with potential influencing power should rise voice against it. 

In garena free fire, one influencer named skylord alone created enough for to the company to stop such dirty marketings.

That’s both faster and more flexible since it doesn’t follow the limitations of regular cards. This 1 elixir ability is by far the most broken thing ever introduced into the game, they could immediately make the ability 2 elixir, halve the radius and it would still be too strong imo.

14825,youtube,@owkword8124,"this is literally the end of clash royale like yeah they've dropped some broken evos and had to nerf them but the dev team must have been on crack when they made ts because they are literally just taking their game and dumping as much shit as they possibly can into one update and ruining the entire premise of their game simply because they want to make more money. They have had such a good thing going and would have maintained a consistent playerbase for several more months, but no, greedy supercell needs everyone to keep ""progressing"" aka spend all their money on the game and re-max all their cards like no, believe it or not people do not want to spend more money to have a competitive deck in the game they like playing and not a single soul asked for this hero bullshit that is literally going to change every single existing meta and ruin every classic strategy and deck currently being used. RG? Just use hero musk. Graveyard? any swarm? xbow? just use hero knight, it makes every troop chase after it like an idiot instead of getting any value at all. And that huge push you built up with the perfect combination of tanks and troops to protect them? nah hero giant will just smack your golem to the other side where it dies unprotected. and mini pekka is just stupid like wow it gains levels couldn't we think of a single other damn concept for essentially a new champion? and what's the point of using evo musk or knight? they are literally 10x weaker than their hero counterparts. Supercell said oh yeah we didn't want to buff the basic stats of cards versus their evolution, but heros? no problem they become walking tanks for the same amount of elixir with absurdly cheap and overpowered abilities. I am DONE with this game. I refuse to spend more money just to keep up with a further ruined meta which will now revolve entirely upon the usage of four cards, which you cannot win against unless you are using one of the brand new gimmicks that completely reset the usage of every beloved strategy brought to the game in the past 9 years. fuck supercell and their greed bro",1 day ago,Heros

We kinda see this interaction at the end when you’re playing against pekka goblin giant and your miner stops attacking the goblin giant. This seems extremely dumb and a huge win for spammers.

In my perfect idea of how this works, the dev team doesn't introduce a radical and gamekilling concept that is all for monetary gain and not the betterment of the experience it provides, waiting of the community to simmer down for a few months in order to release the next fundamentally broken concept for even more monetary gain, and let the cycle repeat again and again and again.

The community needs to show supercell how poor of an idea this concept is by, for example, a petition for voicing opinion or as a threat that if the heroes update happens, X amount of player will leave until our demands are met.

​I am forced to respond. I spend $18 to activate my two Ultimate Triple-X-Ray Princess Towers to fire a burst defense, and deploy my Heroic Golden Elite Barbarians (cost: $5.99 per Barbarian).
​The opponent laughs. They just bought the new Legendary Pay-to-Win Aura for $999, which grants their Mythic Golem 500% health and instant defense piercing. My entire defense evaporates as the Golem sails straight to the bridge.
​In desperation, I deploy my only available card: the $4.99 Single Skeleton. It is one-shot.
​I know the only path to victory. I spend $200 to activate the Divine Champion King Tower, but the Golem looks at it and it instantly drops to 1 HP because the opponent just used the ""Tax Evasion"" emote (cost: $12.50).
​I take out my Super Ultra Mega Heavenly QUADRUPLE Evo Season Shop CREDIT CARD. I swipe it. A card appears: the INSTANT-WIN MEGA P.E.K.K.A. I spend $420 to place it directly on the opponent's tower, destroying it and instantly securing the victory.

Hp wise there isn't that much of a difference, a +5 lv mini pekka still only has about as much hp as a valk. Plus it's still single hit so most swarms still destroy him.


If u wanna look at a broken hero, it's that Heroic knight, I would have said heros were all pretty balanced if it weren't for that shi. It would likely get nerfed after launch tho.",9 hours ago (edited),Heros
15338,youtube,@lichking2568,"​ @Deltexterity  you're assuming that the hero ability works the same as pancake, which it doesn't (I checked it from actual gameplay instead of assuming patterns). Also, it's not 345% higher, it's 245% higher. You're comparing an actual value to an increment. By correct theory, the stats should increase by somewhere between 130% and 245%, but then again, the pancake tower doesn't upgrade exactly linear, but it's close",8 hours ago,Heros

15368,youtube,@therealbigfloppa5512,"they might not be paid for the exact time of release of the videos, but they'll post it asap when they can because from a monetary standpoint you'd obviously want to be the first youtuber to post about it since it would get a lot of views during that time. Think about it this way: would you rather watch a video on a new card when you see it for the first time or after a few days when someone posts the exact same type of video about it. They're probably scheduled to release it as one hero card a day similar to a traditional card reveal type event and paid for the promo of them all as a whole. A sensable reason why they would do this is to, react to the daily feedback on these promo vids and fine tune the cards or adjust future releases of hero cards to further hype and build up to the initial release, but CR and Supercell are so huge any marketing is good promo for them and the creators no matter what they say.",20 hours ago (edited),Heros
15369,youtube,@therealbigfloppa5512,"Also CR is an interesting game where most of the biggest content creators are also top players and interested in competitive and casual play. That is huge for a gaming company and dev team as they get loads of eyes on testing and feedback from the creators and communities. A game like League has an issue where the biggest content creators are not always the best or most knowledgable when it comes to feedback or testing and doesn't have that same amount of reach CR has, so most testing on new releases are internal and public feedback and buffs/nerfs usually only happens on the test server after a champs kit is finalized and this still is usually not enough and it is unbalanced at release. CR probably purposefully releases new cards in this state because it pushes people to spend which from an economic perspective is scummy, but really smart and efficient. League does not have this same incentive as you can almost always buy the champ with free currency on release which leads to more complaints when it is unbalanced. Kinda random, but just thought CR has a really smart business model which is quite rare to find in most games.",20 hours ago,Heros

16514,youtube,@alvi7vivageek,"The concept of transforming favorite cards into something new, heroic in this case, is valid, but the execution here was sloppy and lazy.
First of all, heroic versions are nothing more than transforming cards into Champions, so if Champions already exist, why Heroes? This will kill the use of Champions altogether or make this update for Heroes useless since Champions already exist.
Champions and Heroes are basically the same thing, just with different names.

Regarding the 8-card deck having 2 more special slots; I found it to be a mistake, now there are 4 special slots, half the deck, it will be mandatory to use 2 evolutions and 2 Heroes/Champions in the Deck if you want to play in the meta, in a few years there will be 8 special slots if it continues like this.

SUPERCELL is increasingly showing that Clash Royale is nothing more than a place where it will do everything to extract more money from players, even if it means inventing new concepts and types of cards with sloppy and lazy executions like this one with the Heroes.

I really didn't like that the Heroes were exactly the same as the Champions.

👉 Update: Overall, it seems like it does not change that much to not use your Books right now. It might even be slightly better depending on the number of cards you already have for the card you’d like to upgrade, since you’ll be able to precisely use the right number of Wild Cards. It’s actually very personal: do the math between the level after and before the update and the value of your book before and after the conversion. then choose the best option!!

Literally it's like contaminating the river so you can sell bottled water.

At this point they don't even look at us as customers, you treat nicely and give value to your customers, but here we're treated as their money PROVIDERS so they keep pushing and pushing us to give money and receive nothing in return. Their customers are their investors and we're the product since they expect that we're addicted enough to keep paying for a worse experience.

And don't come saying ""if you don't pay you're not their customer"" since I HAVE paid, actually this is one of the games I've given more money over the years. And I feel stupid for doing so as the game only keeps getting worse and worse and they give the option to give money so it feels less worse than for the others. We all are their customers, even F2P players are, and we're not being respected here.

I endured lvl 15 and paid for a few evos, however I'm no longer giving a single dollar to supercell, I've already given a LOT of money and I'm treated like shit just like everyone else that plays this.

17543,youtube,@Leronus,could not agree more. The wild card cost was absolutely ridiculous and now they just revert back to gold anyway. Not getting a refund in gold for all the time wasted on the EWC bullshit is insane,2 weeks ago,Level_16
17544,youtube,@Leronus,"I just did the math.

Let's use Skeleton Army as an example (Epic)
Before the lvl 15 update, if you were to get 50 extra Skeleton Army cards out of a chest (theoretically) while you had it max lvl 14, you'd get 500 gold per Epic card. That would give you 25.000 gold (50x500).

Since the horrific EWC (Elite Wildcards) update, if you had Skeleton Army max (elite) level 15 you'd get 20 Elite Wildcards per extra Epic card. That would give you 1.000 EWC (20x50).

Since you need 50.000 EWC to upgrade a card from lvl 14 to max lvl 15, that would be the equivalent of 
50.000 EWC divided by 1.000 EWC, which is 50, times the amount of gold you would have gotten otherwise;
50 x 25.000 = 1.25 million gold. 

Let that sink in. So everyone of us that has upgraded a card to lvl 15 has spent 1.25 million gold PER card since the lvl 15 update. 
Yes they are changing it back now which is great for players who have most cards lvl 14. But for anyone that is F2P and has grinded to try and get max lvl 15 cards for the past year it's really really bad. 
Unless we were to get gold compensation but that is obviously not going to happen. 
And keep in mind you will now have to recollect ALL the cards. That you otherwise obviously would have had already. And then there's the books. Lol the more I type this out and think about it the more insane it is. 

It's good they finally got rid of the Wild Cards. The problem is that it should never have been added in the first place. Disguised as an update/feature. 
At the very least compensate players fairly.

As I already said, just for playing every month, and pushing to the ultimate champion, you would get 50k+ ewc's. That means a free MAX card every month. Now you will need to get like what was it? 8.5k cards, for lvl 15+16 plus additionaly like 210k gold? (for a common card) I would need to fact check the numbers, but it's not free anymore.

I do agree that the lack of compensation for already upgraded level 15 cards is insane btw, they gotta give a lot of gems back. this is blown out of the water tbh, i imagine it wont be as bad as everyone thinks it is. also gold isn’t much of a problem, unless you spend all of it immediately. saving gold isn’t that hard, i assume.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

18429,youtube,@b.a.d.boybaits678,"Champion is absolutely not the best thing to upgrade if you are using your cards or wild cards. It only makes sense when upgrading with EWC or books. But the bottom line is if you upgrade a champion to lvl 13-14 you are spending 15 more champion cards and a lot more gold then after the update. Then if you don’t get it to 15 with ewc you still have to spend 11 champion cards to get it to level 15. So in total before the update it will take 28 cards 50k ewc and 175k gold to upgrade lvl 13,14,15. But after the update it will take 24cards and 190k gold from 13,14,15. Already cheaper but not accounting the fact that those 28 cards are only coming from level 13 and 14.

Although its not as much of a significant thing unless you have alot of lvl 14 cards with alot of EWC's ready to spend i still feel like its there to mention. Before update its not only costless but gives you alot of XP but after update if the value of converted EWC to gems matches up perfectly with what it's currently worth in EWC's and upgrades from lvl 14-15 give you only a couple k XP, it may just be better to get as many cards upgraded before update from lvl 14-15 as possible if you have the EWC's to fund (starting with champions ofcourse) to not only capitalise on the costless gold upgrade but also that 50k XP.",13 days ago (edited),Level_16

18472,youtube,@Arnav-d1c,"Champions are the best to upgrade (1:50):
The reduction in cards needed for common, rare, and epic cards is significant, while the reduction for legendaries is small (3:06) and for champions is negligible (3:16). This means books and elite wild cards used on champions retain more value.
Books are being removed, making champion acquisition more difficult in the future (3:37).
Elite wild cards used on Level 14 champions will convert to Level 15 champion progress, making it a safe investment (5:59).

General Upgrade Advice (3:44):
Books: Using Book of Books on a Level 14 champion is recommended for immediate value (4:12). For other books, it depends on your King Tower level; saving them might be better if your King Tower is Level 14 or 15 (4:04).
Wild Cards: Wild cards will be more valuable after the update due to reduced card costs for upgrades (4:50). It's generally advised not to upgrade to Level 11 or above with wild cards before the update.
Gold: Do not spend gold on upgrades before the update, as upgrades will be cheaper by 40% for the same level (5:14).",13 days ago,Level_16

18553,youtube,@arneshpati6459,"The removal of books isn't the main reason why stuff gets harder to upgrade as boss puts it.

The royal API is misleading. 
Their conversion from elite wild cards to cards is absolutely ridiculous. If 1,500 EWC was equal to a champion, I would constantly be turning them into champions. But no you cant do that. The conversion only happens when you get champion overflow. Then they convert to EWC.

Champions didn't reduce from 44 to 42. They went from (30 + 50k EWC) to 42. 
And it is a lot lot easier to get 50k EWC than it is to get 12 champions.

Royal API shows a massive card reduction for commons, but even for commons, it went from (12087 + 50k EWC) to 23087, so, you need 11000 commons instead of 50k EWC. 
That is NOT a -39k cards required. 
You could get 50k EWC every month from rank, will supercell actually add 11000 common wild card worth of rewards to the game after removing EWC? I doubt.
Also, overflow gives absolutely nothing now.",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

   - Team Clash Royale 😊😊",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16
18584,youtube,@JaneSmith-gk9xi,"It's impossible to know what to spend EWC on before the upgrade with 100% certainty because the Clash Royale team has deliberately not provided us with sufficient information to do so. 

Basically, we need to know:
1. Conversion rate of EWC to gems post-update
2. Cost per card for each card rarity in gems post-update
3. Availability of cards for purchase witth gems post-update

If we had 1 and 2, we can calculate how many cards we can purchase with 50k EWC worth of gems post-update to determine if it is better to use the EWC now or let it convert to gems. 

E.g. for Champions, using 50k EWC now gives the equivalent of 11 champion cards of a specific champion post-update, so each card will cost you 4,545 EWC. If it costs more in gems (post-update) than 4,545 EWC converts into to purchase 1 champion card, it is better to use EWC now. 

Similarly, for Legendaries, each card will cost you about 3,571 EWC. If you assume CR keeps the conversion rate at the present values you get for max card overflow (4k EWC for Champions and 1.5k EWC for Legendaries) when converting your EWC to gems, then it would be better to keep your EWC for now. Note however that is the conversion from overflow cards to EWC and not the other way around. If you assume CR team offers gem prices more in line with the awful card offers in the daily shop, then it would be better to use EWC now. Based on my pessimistic outlook on the CR team and their incessant drive for maximum monetization at all cost without regard for their player base, I personally would not risk keeping the EWC.

For 3, what it affects is not the actual cost analysis of using EWC now vs letting them convert to gems, but rather it considers whether you can even get your Champions/Legendaries to level 15 post-update. If for example a specific champion is only available to be purchase once a month, and only 1 card at a time, that would mean theoretically it could take you up to 11 months to upgrade your Champion to level 11 even if you have sufficient gems (assuming you don't get any from Lucky Drops or other sources). Again, we have zero info on this so we can't make any kind of practical judgement.

Overall, I don't trust CR team whatsoever so I intend to use EWCs on all my Champions (and possibly Legendaries) since ultimately imo their objective is just solely profit maximization and not player experience etc so they will screw you over if they can get away with it (again, this is just imo). If you have more faith in the CR team, feel free to hold onto your EWC for now and hope for the best.

Edit: TBH, the real nerf is cosmetic currency only for card overflow post-update, meaning they can just keep giving you cards you have already maxed out and you will have 0 progression. This will be a HUGE hit to progression imo",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

Since supercell was bought by tencent (the fucking chinese of course), its all been downhill. Same with riot games, also bought by tencent. ive been playing league and clash royale for ove 8 years, and ive simultaniously witnessed both companies and games get destroyed for profit. Once you see the pattern its not so crazy anymore. they slowly milk the games that were already good with microtransactions and offers, pumping short term profits but making the community more astranged. Squad busters really is the same as clash and league just on a smaller scale, the only reason these games are still alive is because they were good ONCE, and people like to think they will be again. but if you release a shit game with shit offers and micro's, its gonna die eventually. league and clash are just dying much slower. they can keep hyping them with tournaments and events, but once the economy in these games is so terrible that its no longer worth looking at the games will die. people will lose faith in the company and simply find other games to play. the reason squad busters failed is because they didnt listen to the community, not one single bit. so from my understanding the chinese mother company is ruining our games, and profiting off it. think about it, if the main company is chinese wheres all the money going that you spend on riot or supercell games? right, CHINA. its all going to china. it is genuinely a political and economical scheme to make other countries' game profits go to china. They probably bought supercell with a ridiculously high offer they knew they wouldnt refuse, thus supercell AND riot games basically forfeited all their rights for pity. they have endless money, but cant buy a fucking ear to listen to the community. they are simply sell outs, and all the people that work there know it and support it. its scummy, and none of those games or companies deserve as much love as they get now. if china rules the world in a few decades, wonder where all that money came from. it will most likely be OUR pockets. conclusion, dont buy ANYTHING in ANY tencent games if you dont want your money going straight to winnie the pooh's bank account.",12 days ago,Level_16

and now that i was finally starting to collect enough wild cards and normal card upgrades to max out my king tower and my main deck i see this.

first i uninstalled upon the release of level 14 , then upon the release of mega knight , then upon the relase of champions , then upon the whole level 15 and evolution saga multiple times (especially when evo mk came out) and now this.

they would never listen even though this very portion of players this hurts the most are the true community of clash not some random people tryna install it from social media hype, we played this game for years and supercell never did anything to help us out never.

This is a calculated move, done by a company that knows it can and will get away with it. Supercell isn't stupid. They aren't naive. They know that even if they lose some of their playerbase, the whales will keep playing, and as long as the game is still popular on streams then a lot of the playerbase won't quit.

No matter the conversion now, you can bet money that Supercell will never give such valuable items away cheaply (much less for free) again.
Have fun getting like 10,000 cards without books, because they'll keep drip feeding us like 1-30 wild cards at a time. That's the actual issue - the future option being taken away. Same with other wild cards - the rationale doesn't actually exist. ""You've been saving them :("" okay, because we KNOW you're going to screw us later. It's them essentially liquidating the vaults and ripping up any future ideas of books being able to counteract the level gaps. 

This is not just an issue of the value of cards they will give us (which, if based on crown level, screws the people that need them most. I'm level 13, idk if I should dump my books or convert them.) - it's an issue of what we will be missing in the future.",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

18984,youtube,@Ryzard,"Here's why levels suck, and are a barrier to gameplay being 'fun' - and why people get frustrated.
I use the same ~3-4 cards in almost every single deck because they are generalists that I have at level 14. There are tons of archetypes I want to try, but I simply don't have the cards and gold to max the relevant cards, with some entire archetypes being MAX lv10 for the entire deck.

Gameplay would be massively less repetitive to me because I like to be experiment, and I currently can't.

My choices are this:
Use my maxed cards and adapt them to be a strong core around a win condition,
Use the seasonal boosted level cards (and my core)
Or use an entirely different deck and lose because my cards are consistently 1-5 levels behind my opponents. 

(In addition, the only reason I even have level 14s is card books, and those are about to go kaput, so....)

18987,youtube,@Ryzard,"People have still been saying ""COC does it"" - so.. no, not the same.
COC gives new stuff for new levels and unlocks new aspects of gameplay. CR doesn't - it just adds cost to be competitive.

A lv11 and lv15/16 account are the same, but the numbers are bigger. There is no aspect unlock, there's nothing exciting or interesting, it's just MASSIVELY increased grind without any real equivalent rewards or gains. 

If you've spent months/years in COC maxing your TH and they give a new level, it means you're now prepared to jump into the next th level.
If you've spent months/years in CR maxing out your cards (or if you aren't a whale, 1-4 cards, or a deck, MAYBE two) adding a new level just means that now the whales will all have a massive advantage on you again, and you're behind. It effectively downgrades your cards by making everyone else have the ability to immediately have better ones via spending... Especially if they downgrade the cost to get to the previous Max, meaning you poured extra resources to obtain something that's now subpar.

Also, because the meta constantly shifts in CR, only whales will ever be able to Max the current meta before it shifts away, meaning dolphins, fish, and f2ps are left playing a perpetual game of catch-up.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

1- The ""crystals"" that you use for getting emotes, its basically our bling, you will forget quickly that its in there.
2- maxing a brawler on brawl stars isnt as ""easy"" as you think, you need hella lot of gold to max a brawler, we have a problem where the gold we get its pretty limited, because you need it for EVERYTHING, the gadget, star power, gears, and the hyper. Sure you may can get those on our ""lucky chest's"", but the rng its between that, skins, emotes, sprays (useless), profile icons (also useless). So many f2p players spend all their gold on just one character and need to grind and hold for max another one.
3- in a QnA and the roadmap the devs specified than they weren't gonna put a lvl 12 on brawl, but that was because they were getting money from access anticipated brawlers (like if you preorder a game and they let you play it a week before), but now that theres no more access anticipated brawlers, im kinda scared seeing this.
4- The hyper point that you make its kinda 50% wrong, because there are broken hypers (Ollie's hyper on release, meeple, Kenji on release), and theres these ones that are just bullshit (Charlie, Chuck, Pearl) that they barely change anything gameplay wise (people only use them for the stat bonust).
5- if you pay attention,  you will see that every 5 months or so, one game becomes shittier with a update and the other reaches its peak, kinda funny lol",2 weeks ago,Level_16

The general gameplay structure of Clash Royale works for me in a way few other games do, short games, creative mixes of troops. But the monetization system messes up my enjoyment of the game in ways no other game has managed, of course I haven't played larger scale inifini-monetized games so I can't compare them. I see the value in Supercell's system in that it's allowed them to sustain this product for so long, but they really need to find the flow state where the game is fun and worth paying into without feeling like it drains the players.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

19094,youtube,@MiniShield1,"the game has been doing great recently & they're using the opportunity to make even more money because of the extra new players. This is just pure greed.

When someone asked Drew what was so interesting about adding level 15, he just replied that ""your cards get stronger"". That's it. New levels are not new content, they are just extra unnecessary grind that just pisses people off, but for them, it's extra money. I'm mostly F2P & I've managed to get around 50% of all of my cards to level 15... and now it's all being moved up by one level & I have to re-do the entire process AS WELL AS upgrading all the remaining level 14 cards to level 15 WITH GOLD, just like with level 16. Gold scarcity was an issue before & it was resolved with EWC & now its gonna be an issue again.

The biggest reason why people are pissed about new levels is that reaching the ""endgame"" as a F2P is basically impossible as the goalpost just keeps getting moved away when you get close to achieving it. It's also an issue for P2W players because the money they spent getting to the ""endgame"" is wasted because they're basically told to do it again... for no reason.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

19128,youtube,@observer5393,"🚩 Red Flags: Why the Update Feels Exploitative and Unjustified
The upcoming Clash Royale Level 16 update has alarmed many long-time players. Beneath the surface of new rewards and cheaper mid-levels lies a familiar pattern of monetization-driven design that risks undermining years of player investment.
______________________________________
1. Level 16: The Vertical Progression Reset
Problem — Player Investment Devalued:
Introducing Level 16 instantly erases the sense of completion for fully maxed Level 15 accounts.
Psychological Play — Goalpost Shift:
This is a textbook “goalpost reset.” Whales gain a new money sink, while competitive players must spend again just to retain parity.
Why It’s Unjustified:
A new level is worthwhile only when it adds gameplay depth — new mechanics, slots, or strategic layers. Level 16 delivers only higher stats, forcing players to pay to keep prior breakpoints intact.
______________________________________
2. Elite Wild Cards: Devaluation of a Trusted Currency
Problem — Loss of a Gold-Free Upgrade Path:
Elite Wild Cards once rewarded dedication by allowing upgrades without Gold. Converting them to Gems strips away that benefit.
Psychological Play — Resource Control:
By removing this independent currency and raising Gold costs (≈ 90 k–120 k per upgrade), Supercell redirects spending to its most monetized bottleneck — Gold purchases or Gem conversions.
Result — A Double Monetization Hit:
Players lose a free resource while simultaneously facing a pricier new cap.
______________________________________
3. Mid-Level Cost Cuts: The Illusion of Generosity
Problem — Unequal Benefit:
Lowering upgrade costs for Levels 11–14 looks generous but mainly aids newcomers. Veterans who paid the old rates feel their earlier grind was wasted.
Psychological Play — Progressive Hook:
Cheaper mid-levels accelerate players into the mid-ladder, just before they encounter the steep new Level 16 wall. Once invested, they’re less likely to quit.
Why It’s Short-Sighted:
Long-term loyalty suffers when early adopters see their time and Gold retroactively devalued.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

I think evolutions need to stay (they need people buying pass even at high ladder), but level 11 would be super sweet. A different idea would be to move all ranked rewards to 15K or higher (whatever the trophy road peak is) in high concentration, as well as exclusive seasonal emotes or something, so they can still incentivize trash players to buy stuff to level up to push, and change ranked so that there are no rewards and it is purely competitive.

19283,youtube,@LuizFe67,"I used AI to translate my text.
 I'm not very good writing in English cause it's not my first language, so It's helps me a lot:

If they really wanted to help new players progress, they shouldn’t use Level 16 as an excuse, because there are so many better ways to do that. Plus, the majority of players don’t even have a Level 15 deck yet. I don’t either — my main deck is still missing two Level 15 cards, and that’s because of how hard it was to get EWC.

So yeah, they did something good by removing EWC, but for some fucking reason they added a new and completely useless level that realistically does nothing — and at the worst possible time. And let’s not forget that all new and mid-level players will still need to reach Level 15 and 16, so it just doesn’t make sense to me.
It’s like they can’t do something good without balancing it out with something bad.

It’s even more questionable now since we don’t have books anymore, and when you get cards you already own
maxed, you just get some cosmetic crap coin?! WTF. I already hate getting Level 14 and 15 cards — at least before they turned into EWC that were KINDA useful. (It give you so little that doesn't impact realistically, but it is still better than nothing...)
 For me it always made no sense to get cards that already are maxed lvl...


The reality is that they’ll always be GreedyCell, and they’re incapable of releasing a good update with actual content. All they do is recycle game modes, revive the dead Clash Mini in Clash royale, get rid of global tournaments (which probably will be gone for ever — Royale API said that, or at least I saw a screenshot on last Boss stream showing it).

And every time they add “new content,” there’s always some pay-to-win cap, like new evolutions — considering how hard shards are to get. The new cards are ok, I guess, but only adding that is boring. Plus, we still have to upgrade them to even use them, which is ridiculously hard, so the update ends up being useless. Honestly, every update is trash...


I don’t know if this game will ever be good again, because free-to-play players don’t actually get to play the real game. We’re just grinding levels and cards so that one day we can finally use more options and ACTUALLY play strategically.
For most people, Clash Royale isn’t a strategy game — it’s just a grinding and leveling simulator.",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

But the tumors has grown beyond a point of no return where you consider that point is up to you, but I think for the players that are playing I’d hope that this is there tipping point that that the tumors has consumed what you love it is no longer recognizable it’s time to put it down for good for its sake and for the players who put time into the game and loved it but are now just in pain or “pain” looking at it. We saw supercell lose a game that went global (squad busters) now provided that was a newer game but it proves the giant can bleed and if that game which I can’t say anything about fallen and I imagine with not too many tumors than if we band together we can bring down the tumor filled game together to allow it to rest for good.

I think they are playing a seriously dangerous game here in that they risk really pissing off the spending player base who invested real money into level 15 just for supercell to take it away, could go very wrong for them

19492,youtube,@Aspect_of_the_idiot,"As a mid ladder player the reason why I feel that CoC getting a new townhall level vs CR getting a new level feels more exciting has everything to do with gameplay. 
1. In CoC you aren't forced to go up against someone who has a level advantage, you can just move on and find a different base to raid, while in CR you are forced to play against a player who is higher level and that just feels so unfun to play against.
2. In CoC having a troop who's a level down doesn't feel as detrimental as in CR because at the end of the day it all depends on your strategy and troop placement while in CR interactions change completely if a card is down or up a level forcing you to spend more elixir or giving an advantage since you don't have to spend more elixir.
3. CR devs have been making progression feel worse because they keep adding these amazing things that help you progress or give you good rewards (books in this case) and removing them while in CoC they seem to give you more ways to obtain these items that help you progress faster without having to empty out your bank account. You totally can spend money but it doesn't feel as necessary as CR

I don't know what you can do to solve all these problems that I feel plague this game but for my 1st problem I thought of a possible solution and that is do what they do for challenges and have a level cap on every arena that way you can play on relatively equal footing against your opponent without feeling like shit, I'm in arena 20 and I can't climb anymore because my highest level of card is 13 and that's only on minion and skeleton king the rest are between 9-12 and I keep going up against players who have every single card 14-15, it just doesn't seem fair",2 weeks ago,Level_16

19534,youtube,@opp_goblin,"i don’t wanna put words in your mouth, but i feel like you articulated your concerns about levels pretty poorly here. 

The main difference between clash of clans and clash royale is that one’s whole identity is centered around rewarding the grind, while the other is an actual competitive game that borderline requires it. 

when you have level ups in clash of clans, you have something to work towards. you’re getting more tools at your disposal and you can feel the level change. you see all these new features that the next level has and you say “i want that”. i remember being happy that i finally unlocked my first hero. the levels are actually rewarding and give you cool new toys in return for your progress.

with clash royale, though, you’re not getting stronger, you’re catching up. my level 15 mega knight doesn’t feel stronger than my level 14 one does. levels (for top ladder at least) don’t often give me a strategic advantage or extra power or extra features. they give me a FAIR CHANCE. that’s it. i don’t want to level up my cards because it’s just something i can do and it’s satisfying, i do it because it’s the ONLY WAY I CAN PLAY THE GAME AS IT WAS INTENDED. 

i’ll never forget how many times i’ve lost games to log bait because fire spirit tricking left goblins at 1 HP. and when i finally leveled them up to 15, i wasn’t “happy”, i was empty. i just blew a months worth of progress to fix (not get an advantage) ONE  interaction. 

i’m sure supercell realizes this already but what fucking ever. this games going straight into the dumpster",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

19545,youtube,@muizuim,"1) Getting from level 14 to 15 with elite cards was horrible so im glad they changed it (coming from someone with a maxed level 15 deck) but if they are going to capitalise on fixing their own progression by undoing any good they did by adding level 16 leaves a sweet and sour taste in our mouths. They are literally bundling the good with the bad to make it more digestible.

2) I think removing books because they do not provide value at lower levels makes sense but if new players without any books dont get the equivalent to a book from one drop or from frequent small drops of wild cards in the new system getting to level 15/16 will be the same slow slug fest elite cards were meaning there has been no real change other than the consistency of items.

3) I think having gems be useful could work but if the new prices are just marginally better than 250 gems for 5 epics then they are straight up robbers. For the new gem system to work they need to be great deals because people already assume spending gems on upgrades is a waste which it definitely is right now and always has been.

A few reasons why people like clash of clans updates: First off they always add new things with each level 1-2 troops 1-2 spells and defences aswell as whole new features that can positively impact newer players like equipment or new lower town hall heroes. The second is that they are consistent with upgrade times for lower level player it does not change much considering lower town halls will be decreased and for the new players its consitently about 10 months and they know even if they do not pay they will be able to finish just slower.

19760,youtube,@SublimeLemon101,"One of the very niche things that may matter is the 50000 player xp gained from leveling card to lvl 15. This may be a huge underrated factor on whether to use elite wild cards before or after the update in my opinion. If you are just about at king level 15, there may be a potential benefit to actually spending elite wild cards purely based on the fact that you get 50000 exp in order to level up. This could matter as there is a king tower level dependent conversion of resources after the update.  The extra  conversions may be well worth it depending on if you have been saving your resources or not.  Additionally, if for some reason they do get rid of that xp (I consider it highly plausible considering Clash Royale’s past), that would mean potentially hundreds of thousands of xp lost. Considering the fact that King level 16 will be added as well, in may be worth looking into using elite wild cards to get a higher level. Additionally if you were to level cards up now, you wouldn’t have to pay gold which may be an added bonus. I guess we will have to wait and see as we get more details tho.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

This is what I think about evolutions and even level 15 cards (because of elite wild cards) as well.

20189,youtube,@NoName_____1-n4n,"I mean... should we really be that surprised? Most of Clash Royale's revenue comes from progression, cards, gold, EWCs, Magic Items, etc. Level 16 was inevitable and here it is, in just 14 more days. But with what's coming, a complete rework to progression, more arenas, meaning better lucky drops and chests, gem economy changes, and a currency for maxed out players to get exclusive cosmetics?
Yeah, it does suck that we now have a new level, but at least they're making earlier progression for mid-game players easier (and I really think that most players are around that area anyway). But this is unfortunately how Supercell has to make revenue for CR. Cosmetics can't work, I mean, by 2023, CR were selling Tower Skins for just $2, and emotes and Merge Tactics skins are at absurd prices, (probably because their cosmetic team isn't that big), and Battle Banners are practically free.
Horizontal progression can't work (basically Gadgets and Hypercharges in Brawl Stars) because evolutions are enough, and having a ""Card Power"" for Mega Knight were it's immune to knockback or something would be annoying as hell.
I may be an optimistic CR player who purchases the pass every month, but if they're able to do the progression and gem economy reworks, crystals, and other additions right, then this update can go from bad, to tolerable, to even great. 
The Clash Royale Community as always been... hard to communicate with. I mean, they called the latest update a ""nerf to progression"" despite it adding 2 more evolutions shards to the usual 5. They're times were they should be vocal about certain additions, but just saying ""P2W"" or ""Trash Update"" is never going to tell Supercell how you feel, it's just blind rage. Probably how it's reflected in communication since Clash of Clans and its community are pretty much best friends, especially on Reddit, but Brawl Stars and Clash Royale are just dead silent, since one community is always angry, and other consists of people who don't even know how to read. (Fun Fact Brawl Stars players: Did you know that Brawl Stars NERFED Bling in Starr Drops, and other Loot Boxes?! Yeah! Instead of getting a petty 1000 Bling as a fallback from that Legendary, now, you get 200 Bling!!!! WOW, Such a W update, chat!)

Have you ever wonder why levels don't exist in other such card games? It's because its inherently unfair and unbalanced. They only exist in CR as a form of progression and, to a greater and greater extend, monetization.

If you want to bully a level 12 with level 15 cards, you can do Trophy Road. Ranked should allow everyone to be on the same level, both metaphorically and literally, so that skill and strategy is the defining factors in deciding how good you are at the game",2 weeks ago,Level_16

And on top of that, i still believe cards health bars need a rework since some cards (Pekka i'm looking at you) have way more health than others and that is not reflected on their hp bar, making it harder to know when a tanky card is going to die by tower damage or you actually need to use another card/spell to ensure it won't reach your tower. imagine a level 16 pekka going to your lvl 14 tower, the pekka´s hp bar is barely visible, only a sliver of health left, but since your tower is 2 levels lower the pekka manages to hit your tower once, maybe twice, that makes the level gap matter even more",2 weeks ago,Level_16

their talk about removing books is fair but they should give something in return, not just ""remove them"". They can like give more wild cards from chests. 

Books were broken in concept, low level player had to save them and not use them until level 14 , and after EWC they had no use at all since you can't use them to upgrade.

Brawl Stars: HIGH INDIVIDUAL CONTROL and levels upgrades are linear (so the status difference are less impactful on the high and more expensive levels)

Clash Royale: MEDIUM CONTROL and levels growth exponentially. The gameplay is most based on the INTERACTION between card, so an over leveling can change completely some important interactions!

20670,youtube,@GhostKingBS,"Level upgrade of Brawl Stars was the WORST

After that update in 2021 brawl stars started to fell down in popularity and seriously damaged the games gameplay 
It took 1 year to fix gears because back then it was not only to get new to levels
But it was even worse to upgrade new abilities gears not hypercharges
Hypercharges was implemented a bit later to make leveling up more meaningful and god it was a way better options than gears which made gameplay complex not in a good way
Mostly it took away the simplicity of brawl stars
And made it complex not in a good way 

Just imagine how many interactions would have changed in clash royale if you could give 2 different type of buffs out of 5 for each card
Where a card would have 
-more hp
-more damage when low
-and 50% ressistance for slowing, stun and knockback abilities (yes we had it in brawl stars and it was almost useless)

And did i mentioned that each ability has its own currency for unlocking and upgrading it

Some gear abilities  were way better than the others and later they changed gears in a way that you could buy them for coins without any other currency and we got new type of gears for some brawlers which worked like starpowers


Funny enough that after hypercharge addition they slowed down and then stopped adding new unique gears for brawlers",2 weeks ago,Level_16

the problem with new levels in Clash Royale is that not only do they not add anything meaningful gameplay-wise, but they are also problematic in the terms of card interactions

another thing is that everytime they add a new TH lvl, it comes along with significant reductions and the new TH gets just slightly higher

the reductions in the CR card levels are not only very small, but maxing yourself is overall more expensive because of the severely decreased rewards you get by playing normally (or even try harding challenges, which will now not be that good of an option since gems now are gonna be used for cards)",2 weeks ago (edited),Level_16

20697,youtube,@nonmagicalwitch,"And Clash of Clans entire idea is slowly building out your Village. It's non-direct pvp, which not only takes away a lot of the frustration of having to fight someone higher levelled than you, the star system means anything but a 0 Star is counted as a win. You can go in, beat 50% of someones Village, steal some of their loot and both of you are happy. The attacked has defended themselves from a 2 or 3 star and the attacker can use the loot they've collected to strenghten their village. It's not a zero-sum game. Clash Royale on the other hand is a zero-sum game, to the point where you lose exactly as many trophies as the one who has beat you gained. This means not only that the game is prone to toxicity, but also that level differences are an actual unfair advantage instead of just a minor hinderance. That's the reason I actually liked the ranked mode until they got rid of the level caps. I loved playing Challenges because you could very easily upgrade all your cards to lvl. 9 and have fun with them.

Plus there is less of a need to get to the next Town Hall because you can still play the game at an equal playing level to other players. With CR you need to be the same level as others to make it feel fair. I don't think there is a really solution to the level system in CR. IT's just to pad the game and at PTW.

Then as you upgrade your king level you get access to different cards ,stronger and more interesting mechanics and with each two levels you get a new skin for the troop (you can pick which of the 8 skin variants you want to apply). Moreover you can make the matchmaking go against king towers of the same level with decks averaging the same level cards . 

In this way they can maket it as a “new king level” essentially making a dreadful addition into a hyped one (moreover you can add hammer jam ,in which troops and king tower  need half of the resources to upgrade )",2 weeks ago,Level_16

For clash royale, not only does a new card level not add new content, it increases the grind tenfold and makes sure to squeeze more money through existing content by increasing the p2w aspect of the game.

On top of that, they said about a year ago that there wouldn’t be a Level 16.

It honestly feels like Supercell is trying to turn Clash Royale into Clash of Clans: releasing a new level every year so players always have something to upgrade. But that just doesn’t work here. In CoC, people play for progression, you can skip overleveled enemies, and your village constantly changes as you upgrade. Clash Royale is completely different. Nobody plays CR for the levels – they only cause frustration when someone wins unfairly because they paid more.

 Miracles happen man. My mom knew a Catholic priest who could foretell the future. and not just in some sketchy way, he told mom that my dad would be willing for marriage? if she wanted to? (even tho she said she had no boyfriend cuz maybe she didn't see the relationship as bf+gf yet or whatever? + dad probs didn't talk with the priest Abt it, I asked.) and predicted a birth nine years prior? and told a person he met first time in His life? that there's no man for her in the country, then after many years she travelled abroad to find a job and found a husband there. and after asking him for help, a hard healing/not healing infected? wound that was distracted by doctors to be cancer was healed with the use of *aloe*. + many other ppl were visiting him, asking for healing. he also helped with a chronic? condition?, making it go away once forever?

But you cannot ingore how much it looks like they have just lifted the soft cap that they placed om themselves 2½ years ago,and decided to go back to just giving everyone new levels to grind when they see that enough people have upgraded their collection to a certain point.

Like,there was a small reason to celebrate lvl 15,because they made it SEEM like the final level,so at least we wouldn't get any more.

The removal of books also has a valid reason,but at the same time,I think just because of how satisfying it is to use one for full value,they should've kept them and tried to make them fit in the new economy.It generally is one of the few times you're extremely happy you can upgrade a card.

That being said,my peanut brain didn't want to look at the numbers you showed because they were all in black and white,so Idk how much worse the amount of cards and gold needed will be.

Either way,they're not a full economy breakdown,which I would really look forward to as a sneak peek.

lets say u got a level 13 card but u are king tower level below 14, i guess u should use it to get the card to level 14 because u otherwise would get less wild cards than the ones u would be using, but they did make the card cheaper to upgrade so nobody knows what's really best, maybe if u wait u could spend less gold that's it

As for evolutions, when they were first added they had stat boosts which made them just an objectively better version of a troop. Now that evolutions are easy to get and they don't have stat boost (with some exceptions), they're hated less.

You grind more, you pay more to maintain the exact same interaction and experience you've once have with lower level cap. Because suddenly now level 15 is underleveled, you have to pay more just to be the same as before, nothing new

 Miracles happen man. My mom knew a Catholic priest who could foretell the future. and not just in some sketchy way, he told mom that my dad would be willing for marriage? if she wanted to? (even tho she said she had no boyfriend cuz maybe she didn't see the relationship as bf+gf yet or whatever? + dad probs didn't talk with the priest Abt it, I asked.) and predicted a birth nine years prior? and told a person he met first time in His life? that there's no man for her in the country, then after many years she travelled abroad to find a job and found a husband there. and after asking him for help, a hard healing/not healing infected? wound that was distracted by doctors to be cancer was healed with the use of *aloe*. + many other ppl were visiting him, asking for healing. he also helped with a chronic? condition?, making it go away once forever?

So now momo and all the pros will have to max all of the cards so they can play this scammy game properly?

I got 4 champions maxed and let me tell you that getting 20 mf champion wild cards was a nightmare, you only get like 3 champion wild cards per month and you have to PRAY for the lucky drops to give you something that isn't 45k gold.

Supercell keeps saying these updates are for the players, but if that’s really the case, then do everything else you’re doing except adding another level.

Like seriously, what’s the point of another level? The whole game is based on how cards interact, and that balance is maintained through balance changes — not by adding more levels. The only thing higher levels do is make the game more unfair for anyone with lower-level cards.

If you actually cared about the players, you’d think about removing levels altogether (obviously not gonna happen) instead of adding more. You say it’s for players with maxed accounts, but let’s be real — nobody who just finished maxing their cards, whether by grinding or paying, is wishing for another level. It just feels like you’re making up reasons to do what you want, not what’s best for the players.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

It's been years, I've been telling myself the same thing for years and years and years. This game has so much potential and it is just P2W. I wish there was competition.

 Overwatch 2 was really badly monetized at it's start as well and Activision-Blizzard been bought by Microsoft, the CEO has changed, Marvel Rivals was a huge competition. They fixed most of the issues. As a F2P in that game I can get any cosmetic I want minus the ones in the shop but if I get lucky (I did) I can get them from Lootboxes. They gave out like hundreds of those with events. 

Too bad Marvel Rivals shot themselves in the foot doing all the mistakes OW2 had in its inception. Like extremely high dmg and healing etc. The characters are supposed to be different and unique yet all the supports have the same ultimate, too many dps heroes and boring tanks. I played Groot and there is so much intricate inner workings of that hero it is crazy fun.

That is to say my only leveled up win conditions are Xbow and hog, and the only decks I have cards leveled for them are for 2.6 and 3.0 cycle decks. So I can’t even really experiment with new decks or learn from watching your gameplay because realistically you and I play two completely different games. All your interactions are set in stone, my interactions vary game to game. I can’t even attempt to learn hogquake or icebow. 

Xbow is the only deck I can win with really, because people don’t know how to play against it where I’m at. But it always goes to one tower games and that takes long as fuck so it just gets kind of boring which is something I did not factor when I chose the deck.

The worst part is that we're not being compensated in any way. No new, cool content, no attempt at an apology, and zero transparency.

If they were to remain level 15 is as it is, with regular cards, it will be much easier to get a level 15 than it is currently, and as to offset this. They are adding level 16. Yes, they are adding a new level, but getting a card to this level is actually cheaper than getting a card to level 15 right now. I don't understand the outrage, they are making the game cheaper. The only drawback I can see is the removal of books, and trying to max out higher rarity cards. I'm not writing this out of spite but I think its justified.",2 weeks ago,Level_16

22160,youtube,@SprocketSAB,"Honestly, watching this Clash Royale YouTuber play feels like a masterclass disguised as entertainment. The way they break down every interaction—from elixir trades to micro-timing on placements—shows a level of awareness that most players don’t even realize exists. They don’t just play the game; they read it like a living story, predicting pushes before they happen and adjusting their strategy with a calm confidence that makes every match feel like a showcase of pure, calculated brilliance. Even when the opponent throws out something chaotic or unexpected, they handle it with a kind of smooth adaptability that makes impossible defenses look effortless and risky counterpushes look artfully planned.

What makes them stand out even more is the way they explain their thought process while still keeping the energy light, funny, and genuinely enjoyable. They never talk down to their audience—instead, they uplift them, teaching complex ideas in a way that feels natural and exciting. Their content has this perfect balance: high-level gameplay for the competitive fans, clear tips for newer players, and charismatic personality for everyone in between. It’s the kind of channel you can watch for hours without getting bored because every video feels like a combination of skill, creativity, humor, and passion.

On top of all that, the editing, pacing, and overall presentation show just how much care goes into every upload. It’s obvious they’re not just hitting “record” and hoping for the best; they’re crafting something worth watching. Whether they’re trying out off-meta decks, climbing ladder with insane precision, or taking on challenges that look impossible until they magically make them work, they bring a uniqueness that sets them apart from every other creator in the Clash Royale community.

In short, they’re not just a good Clash Royale YouTuber—they’re one of those rare creators who make the game more exciting, more accessible, and more inspiring for everyone who watches. Their content elevates the entire community, and it’s genuinely a pleasure to see someone bring that much skill, personality, and creativity to every single match they play.",11 hours ago,Level_16

23471,youtube,@wedd4290,"Level 16 and Gem Upgrades
 * Gems will be used to help upgrade cards to the next level [00:00].
 * The gem cost varies by card rarity:
   * Champion Cards: Upgrading one from level 15 to 16 with gems costs 6,000 gems. Upgrading one entirely with gems costs 16,800 gems total [02:18].
   * Legendary Cards: Upgrading one from level 15 to 16 costs 4,200 gems. Upgrading one from level 9 all the way to 16 costs 14,270 gems [02:30].
   * Common, Rare, and Epic Cards:
     * Until a card reaches level 8, every upgrade costs 100 gems in total [02:43].
     * Upgrading a Common card from level 14 to 15 costs 2,000 gems [03:08].
     * Upgrading a Rare card from level 14 to 15 costs 2,100 gems [03:15].
     * Upgrading an Epic card from level 14 to 15 costs 2,500 gems [03:23].
 * The gem price automatically adapts to the number of cards you already own [03:38].
Chests and Evolutions
 * Magic Lucky Chests now come with levels (up to level 16) depending on your arena, and the quantity of cards increases with the chest level [00:29].
 * The focus in Magic Lucky Chests is now on cards and wild cards. Books, wild shards, and elite wild cards are gone from these chests [00:48].
 * Evolution Boxes are the main source of evolutions and come in three rarities: Epic (single random shard), Legendary (up to two shards), and Champion (a full evolution) [01:04].
Pass Royale Rework
 * Hero Pass Royale is unlocked above 5,000 trophies and features a brand new hero for December (Hero Mini Pekka) [01:20].
 * If you are below 5,000 trophies, your pass contains six wild evolution shards instead [01:36].
 * The main rewards across the pass are now wild cards [02:00]. An evolution shard has been moved earlier to Tier 20 [01:52].
Elite Wild Cards and Magic Books
 * The video advises the creator's personal choice to spend elite wild cards now before the conversion rates are revealed because the high-level gem costs are very expensive [03:54].
 * The video suggests to save Magic Books, as their conversion value is acceptable. The only exception is if you are already level 15, in which case using a Book of Books might be fine since the conversion gives 6,000 gems (enough for a Champion from 15 to 16) [04:25].
 * Remember to save unclaimed rewards from Pass Royale, Ranked, and Trophy Road for a small early boost when the update drops [04:46].",4 days ago,Level_16
