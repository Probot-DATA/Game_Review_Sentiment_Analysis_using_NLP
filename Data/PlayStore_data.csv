10,lvl 16 is a joke. they promised lvl 15 would be max! This update is purely a cash grab. the game is even more p2w now. Cannot recommend.,1,2025-11-25 18:22:11,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
11,Do not waste your time with this game. The devs will always move the goalposts as to what makes an account competitive so that the only way to truly compete is to swipe your credit card many times. They add new levels and completely unbalanced powerful cards only to nerf them the second their is a new overpowered card (of course you will need to pay money to have a reasonable chance of playing with these cards at a high level),1,2025-11-25 18:21:56,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
12,"This game is an absolute banger, Supercell's take on real time strategy with millions of different possibilities at the tip of your fingers is incredibly well executed overall, that being said, in its current state I'd say it can become frustrating to play as its pay to fast scheme gives players too much of an advantage over free to play. This issue has been growing worse over time, leaving certain players outside of the competitive scene. All in all, great game, HORRENDOUS progression.",2,2025-11-25 18:20:01,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

1154,Stopped playing the game when they decided that every evolution needs to be broken and have some way of countering every deck. Not to mention the monetization is just predatory. Everything is a 22x deal when they don't even know what that means.

I've played this game everyday for about 4 months now and now that they pick up some momentum, they decide to add heroes and a new card level to further push anyone wanting to enjoy the game further down the paywall hole.

1202,It has been fun for years but the recent changes seem to be motivated by money. I Understand these products are made for profit but the price hikes and now harvesting player data for ads and for whatever reason the game suddenly requires cookies after running fine for ages without it. It went from Free-to-play friendly to down right pay-to-win. Disgusted with the latest changes and the constant moving of the goal post.

1591,Do not start this game right now. it is fine currently but the next update introduce 2 features that do nothing but brake the game open; level 16 and heroes. Level 16 is just a cashgrab because it changes nothing exept you having to spend money and heroes are the most broken thing to be introduced ever. people not buying pass or the heroes themselves wont have the sliver of a chance of success.,3,2025-11-24 19:44:45,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

This update just make my all efforts waste.I am just a normal player who doesn't waste money. It take me 2 years and more to make my card level 15 but this greedy clash royale developer just make card level 16 which they don't even give compensation.I had more to rant but only 500 letter is allowed so i will end here.,1,2025-11-24 19:44:24,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

Here's a thought! quit being lazy and make new characters instead of ripping people off of their elite status so they have to gain it all over again.

2439,Just made it to one of the highest arenas. To be unbiased. The f2p aspect is horrible. Progression this way would be slowed. There are some arenas (that happened to me) I would get stuck because I was underleveled (totally didn't involve my skill) one level higher isn't bad. I shouldn't be facing a lvl 14 MK while being lvl 11. Evo shards have gotten easier but still hard to get quite a few.

2477,"really disappointed in the little care supercell has for it's clients, they can't respond to reviews and when they do it's a bot that answers you. awesome games but the data costs are way to much so download if you have money to waste but if you don't want to to lose all your mobile data in three minutes than rather skip this games, any supercell games for a matter of fact. Edit: No changes from supercell, they just don't care about the people anymore they just want more money",1,2025-11-23 09:44:44,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
2478,This is the worst game you can play If you want to win in this game you have to pay. At first it was good but When you play it for some time you will realise that if you can't pay then you can't win in this game They are going to make it more pay to win game by introducing new characters Don't play this game if you can't pay Thank you for reading My review,1,2025-11-23 09:37:31,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
2479,its a overall great game but the pay to win aspects makes it less fun because of the over level troops and free to play people get stuck on lower arenas and seeing that their adding level 16 when no one is asking is horrible. this means they aren't listening to the community and ruining the game. and extra point they are adding heroics so basically more champions and more chaos so they are ruining their fanbase and sometimes making horrible events,3,2025-11-23 09:37:22,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

They are now releasing level 16, adding new hero troops which are busted, adding 2 hero/champion slots, and taking your wild cards and exchanging them for gems, which at the time of this review they have not made the exchange rate public, meaning it will be terrible and they want to rip their players off for as much as they can manage.

Here comes evolution you pay you get so much edge early. Or grind for 4 to 5 months to get one if you play moderately. It is sightly fixed now but still not good. the only viable way to get evolution is to pay for it. also fix match making 1 level difference may not look much but when you loose because opponent have 10 or 15 hp left feels like broken mechanics",1,2025-11-23 03:19:39,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

Every game you'll play is decided before anyone even plays a card, and no amount of skill or experience will factor into it at all.

2684,supercell likes to keep the same 2 cards meta always and make the game unplayable for anybody who doesn't run the most meta decks. with every new update you make your game worse and worse.

3444,"The game is horrible. As soon as I got to Area 14, they matched me up with like pros. And I can't ever win the game. Like the game should go like this, based on whoever u win against, that's who u should go against the whole game, like I won one game in arena 14 and then they match me up with a pay-to-win. 6 years of playing. and just a demi god at everything. I rate it one star because it's a crash-out game, and they need better matchmaking.",1,2025-11-21 07:47:30,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

3477,I know the game advertised strategy but there isn't an ounce unless you spend a ton of money. progression is painful and slow and I've been playing for 2 years now and I'm still struggling because of the amount of whales there are in this game. it's all luck are you gonna verse someone with the same levels as you or are you gonna to go against a whale who has the next busted Evo. plus they never listen to the community anymore. this game used to be perfect but greed killed it. no lvl 16 pls.,1,2025-11-21 05:57:49,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

3503,"Cash grab slop. I've been playing this game on and off for 8 years. Recently this entire game is based off of money. I have a couple nearly maxed out cards, great right? Nope the matchmaking idiocy follows a rule of pairing you against players 'near your card levels.' I've gotten one match in the last 20 that had lower levels then me, yet when I'm underleveled every match is against maxed players. Then I got the news, level 16? More level difference between me and brainless mega knight players?",1,2025-11-21 04:59:27,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
3504,Rewriting this review because there is a lot to talk about. First we have level 15. That was the most horrible decision by Supercell ever. After that there were the evolutions which at the time of release were completely unbalanced and gamebreaking. Then of course we can't forget about the season shop removal which fans are to this day demanding back. Which brings us to now where supercell decides to finally address the EWC problem by adding a whole new level. This game is horrible please avoid,1,2025-11-21 04:58:51,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

I'm a f2p player and have pushed past 10k trophies and I can say confidently the difference between 10k and 15k is the amount of money you've spent on the game and whether you will play the meta or not. Nothing but bridge spam and logbait anymore, so boring even when you win, only entertaining at the highest level but good luck getting there since they consistently make it harder to progress as f2p every update.",2,2025-11-20 10:27:41,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

All they care about is money. I've been playing since day 1 and what has happened to this game is absolutely despicable. Wonder how many paid players they lost by doubling the monthly price of Pass Royale...

3989,I am deleting this game after years of playing. just recently they took all of my players and reduced their level to 11. i have not wo. a game since. they say it is to make play more fair but it is really to force you to purchase. i will not. i did in the past but never again. so my recommendation is to find a different game to play. one that is fair to its players.,1,2025-11-19 19:03:40,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

4428,"Don't get me wrong, this game is great. I love it, I've played it for years, but come on Supercell, you've completely ruined this game. it's impossible to enjoy it in higher arenas without getting completely destroyed by either bots with a hard counter for your deck, or p2w players that make free to play players completely outmatched. It pains me to write this, but it really needs to be brought to their attention",2,2025-11-18 11:13:42,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play
4429,it's a pay to win game I spend like 10 hours getting levels then the second I join a match with a p2w that means pay to win ) they play like a elite mega knight while I'm at frozen peak he's at like level 26 and I'm at 17 it's so stupid and once you get to higher arenas the game gets more addicting and that means you'll want to spend money. come on supercell you are better then targeting kids for their money at least bring down the prices or bring back latest day discounts,1,2025-11-18 11:13:19,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

4438,"If you enjoy the game then play it, but the truth is only a very small percentage of people do. Most just play it because of some sunk cost fallacy. If youre thinking about playing it dont, you probably wont enjoy it after a certain point because its designed to be as frustrating as possible. All of this is done intentionally to push you into making purchases and toxicity is encouraged by devs. Matchmaking is designed to keep you at 50% winrate its statistically impossible to have these matchups",1,2025-11-18 10:27:41,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

4527,The actual gameplay is decent but is extremely unfair. They purposely make you go against players with decks that counter yours and against higher level cards so you lose more and get mad for losing crowns and then play more to try and recover the crowns you lost. It's also pay to win since you can buy stuff to level your cards and have an advantage against players with the same cards. If supercell wasn't such a greedy company then this would be a alright game.,1,2025-11-18 04:37:23,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

4570,"I am currently at 10k trophies and my journey there was nothing but torture. Not only is this game incredibly pay to win, to the point where you can be trash and simply win because youve spent $100 dollars on the game. As someone who has spent $20 on this game, it makes a wild difference. This game also has a delay every time you try to place a card. I know this isn't a wifi or hardware issue since Im running Warzone Mobile perfectly and even did a wifi speed test.

The experience of playing ladder is terrible in most promotion matches expect abnormally over levelled opponents. Core idea of the game is great. Good cards, evos, gimmicks but the overleveled commonly braindead meta ruins it something needs to change.

I can win games with 3 tanks in mere seconds around 4500 trophies no problem and the only players I only ever have a problem with is players who just sit and wait all game for you to place a card down 1st just to play defensive and get petty counter wins. all 0 skill to play the game.",1,2025-11-17 00:16:41,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

This game on my opinion needs to fix a lot of things it needs to make it less pay 2 win and when you lose a match it needs to give you an easier opponent.,1,2025-11-16 12:54:18,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

The adding of level 16 is going to destroy this game for F2P, and it annoys me how Supercell have made such a good game, but are going to ruin it.",3,2025-11-15 16:10:27,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

5548,"Clash Royale used to be great, but recent changes have made it frustrating. The new arena-wise card distribution feels unnecessary—fun cards like Witch or Prince used to be available early but are now moved. Matchmaking has also become unfair. As a level 14, I constantly face level 15 opponents with perfect counter decks. The counter card are always in their hand and never(totally never)mine's??.

5963,Trash game honestly. Most of time gives me bots and not REAL people. This is why I downloaded it but THEY HAVE INFINITE ELIXER. These bots get elixer so fast and possibly CANNOT have that much elixer.,1,2025-11-14 14:19:02,Play_Store_Updates,Google_Play

5982,"11000+ trophies f2p player, progression was a lot easier when ranked wasn't locked to 15k trophies, p2w players level up faster but that's nothing to be surprised about.
